# Generative-AI-LLM
Generative AI with LLM, From prompt engineering to Fine-tuning and Domain adaptation

The above objective is achieved with a use case as "News article summarization into 60 words - An replica of [Inshorts](https://www.inshorts.com/) using Gen AI"

The [Prompt Engineering Part 1](https://github.com/HariniNarasimhan/Generative-AI-LLM/blob/main/LLM-Prompt-Engineering-Part1.ipynb) covers the following
1. General Dataset loading from huggigface
2. Model loading from hugging face
3. Template understanding of the model's input for your use case
4. Instruction prompting
5. Zero-shot Inference
6. One-shot and Few-shot inference
7. General configuration parameters (max_new_tokens, top-k, top-p, temperature )and their impact on the model's results.
